       <p>It goes without saying that Supreme has a storied history of collaborations: be it with sportswear giants like Nike; contemporary artists like Damien Hirst; industrial design brands like Braun; or filmmakers like David Lynch and Harmony Korine, the downtown Manhattan powerhouse has built and maintained strong creative ties across all areas of culture. But some of Supreme’s most memorable and resonant collaborations to date have been those that stepped outside the bounds of streetwear, fashion, and design, tapping pop cultural icons to expand the brand’s visibility and influence. For reference, campaigns usually consist of a poster and photo t-shirt featuring a celebrity rocking the brand’s signature box logo design. The posters are then glued to walls, scaffolding, and mailboxes; the tees are always some of the most ravenously desired pieces in every collection. Occasionally, the brand will release behind-the-scenes videos and tidbits for fans to pore over online. These are the closest thing that Supreme comes to advertising in the traditional sense of the word. So when news broke of The Smiths frontman Steven “Moz” Morrissey’s conflicted involvement in Supreme’s upcoming spring/summer drop, HYPEBEAST took a look back on some of the skate-shop’s best endorsements, campaigns, t-shirts and photoshoots with A-listers of all walks of life, from rappers and supermodels to Muppets.
